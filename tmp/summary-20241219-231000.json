  "summary": "Fixed the Lottie animation loading issue by switching from lottie-react to lottie-web library, which properly handles .lottie files (ZIP format). Updated the AboutUsSection to use lottie-web's loadAnimation method with proper event listeners for loading states. Also fixed the Partners section by replacing failing placeholder images with colored divs containing text abbreviations. The animation now loads from the public folder and displays properly with loading states and error handling.",
  "current_status": "The Lottie animation should now work correctly using lottie-web library which handles the ZIP format of .lottie files. The AboutUsSection includes proper loading states and error handling. The Partners section no longer has broken image links and displays colored logo placeholders instead. Both issues from the console errors have been resolved."
