  "summary": "Replaced the problematic Lottie animation with a custom CSS-based construction animation using Framer Motion. The new animation features a main building with windows and a light, a construction crane with moving parts, animated construction tools (hammer, wrench, hard hat), floating construction particles, and a progress bar. All elements have smooth animations with different timing and delays to create a dynamic construction scene. This approach is more reliable than the Lottie file which was causing XMLHttpRequest errors due to format issues.",
  "current_status": "The About Us section now displays a custom animated construction scene instead of the problematic Lottie animation. The animation includes multiple animated elements: a building with pulsing light, a rotating crane, floating construction tools, and particle effects. All animations are smooth and performant using Framer Motion. The section is now fully functional without any loading errors or console issues."
