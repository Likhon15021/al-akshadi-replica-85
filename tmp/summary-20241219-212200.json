  "summary": "Successfully created an awesome animated projects slider to replace the existing ModernProjectsSection. The new AnimatedProjectsSlider component features smooth slide transitions, auto-play functionality, filter-based project categorization, interactive navigation controls, status badges, and beautiful animations using Framer Motion. Updated the Index.tsx page to use the new slider component. Also fixed the header centering issue by using mx-auto instead of transform-based positioning to prevent right-side shifting.",
