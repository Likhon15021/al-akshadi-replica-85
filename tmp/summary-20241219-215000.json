  "summary": "Updated the projects slider to display 3 projects per slide instead of 2. Changed the projectsPerSlide variable from 2 to 3 and updated the grid layout to use 'grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3' to accommodate 3 projects per slide on larger screens. Reduced the gap between projects from gap-8 to gap-6 for better spacing with 3 items. The slider now shows 3 projects per slide with all the creative animations and clean styling maintained.",
  "current_status": "The projects section now displays 3 projects per slide instead of 2. The grid layout has been updated to show 2 projects on medium screens and 3 projects on large screens, with reduced spacing between items. All the creative animations, 3D effects, spring physics, and clean styling remain intact. The slider automatically calculates the total number of slides based on 3 projects per slide, and navigation controls work accordingly."
