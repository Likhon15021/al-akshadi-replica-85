  "summary": "Transformed the 'Our Projects' section from the dark iOS 26 beta theme to a bland/neutral design. Changed the background from black to light gray (bg-gray-50), updated all text colors from white to gray tones, replaced bright gradient animations with subtle gray gradients, and converted all glass morphism elements to use neutral gray and white colors. The section now has a clean, minimal, and bland aesthetic while maintaining all the sophisticated animations and functionality.",
  "current_status": "The projects section now features a bland, neutral design with light gray background, gray text colors, and subtle gray gradient animations. All UI elements use neutral colors - white/gray backgrounds, gray borders, and gray text. The floating particles are now subtle gray dots. The design maintains all the creative animations and interactions but with a much more subdued, bland color palette that creates a clean and minimal appearance."
