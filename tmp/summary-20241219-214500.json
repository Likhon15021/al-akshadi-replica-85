  "summary": "Added one more project (SUMS Heights) to the ongoing projects list and completely removed background colors and shadow effects from the projects section. Implemented highly creative animations including 3D rotations (rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ), spring physics, staggered timing, and complex entrance effects. Project cards now have creative entrance animations with 3D perspective, spring-based transitions, and interactive hover effects. Status badges have spinning entrance animations, View Details buttons have rotating entrance effects, and content elements have layered 3D animations. The MapPin icon has a continuous rotating animation. All animations use spring physics for natural, bouncy movements.",
  "current_status": "The projects section now features 7 projects total with completely clean styling (no background colors or shadows) and highly creative animations. Each project card has complex 3D entrance animations with spring physics, interactive hover effects with 3D rotations, and staggered timing for a dynamic experience. Status badges spin into view, buttons rotate into position, and content elements have layered 3D animations. The MapPin icon continuously rotates for added visual interest. The overall effect is a modern, dynamic, and engaging user experience with sophisticated animation choreography."
