  "summary": "Removed the icon and description from the 'Our Projects' section header, keeping only the main title text. Removed the Building2 icon with its circular background container and the descriptive paragraph about premium living spaces. The section header now contains only the 'Our Projects' title with the gradient text effect, creating a cleaner and more minimal design.",
  "current_status": "The projects section header is now simplified to show only the 'Our Projects' title text without any icon or description. The header maintains the gradient text effect on 'Projects' and the smooth animation entrance. The filter pills and all other functionality remain intact. The overall design is now cleaner and more minimal while preserving all the creative animations and interactive features."
