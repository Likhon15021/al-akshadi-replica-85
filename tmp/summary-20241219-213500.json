  "summary": "Successfully removed the 'Experience Our Projects' video section and added parallax video backgrounds to each project card for a real estate vibe. Each project now features a subtle video background with auto-play, muted, and loop properties that creates a dynamic real estate atmosphere. The video backgrounds have reduced opacity (30% normal, 50% on hover) and are overlaid with gradient effects. Removed unused video-related state variables and functions. The project cards now have a more immersive real estate feel with the parallax video backgrounds.",
  "current_status": "The projects section now features project cards with parallax video backgrounds that create a dynamic real estate atmosphere. Each card has a subtle video background that plays automatically, muted, and loops continuously. The video backgrounds are overlaid with gradients and the main project images, creating a layered visual effect. The 'Experience Our Projects' standalone video section has been completely removed. All animations and interactions remain smooth and responsive."
