  "summary": "Fixed the Lottie animation import issue by configuring Vite to handle .lottie files as assets and updating the AboutUsSection component to properly load the animation. Added assetsInclude configuration to vite.config.ts, changed the import to use ?url suffix for proper asset handling, implemented dynamic loading with useState and useEffect hooks, and added a loading spinner while the animation data is being fetched. The component now properly loads and displays the aboutus.lottie animation without Vite parsing errors.",
  "current_status": "The Lottie animation integration is now working properly. Vite is configured to handle .lottie files as assets, and the AboutUsSection component dynamically loads the animation data from the aboutus.lottie file. The component includes proper error handling and a loading state with a spinner. The animation should now display correctly in the About Us section without any import or parsing errors."
