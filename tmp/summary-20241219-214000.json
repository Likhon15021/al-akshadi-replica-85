  "summary": "Fixed the parallax video background visibility issue and redesigned the projects section with a minimal iOS 26 style. The video backgrounds are now properly visible with increased opacity (60% normal, 80% on hover) and are layered behind the project images. Implemented iOS 26 design elements including backdrop blur effects, subtle borders, minimal typography, and clean spacing. Updated status badges and buttons to use iOS 26 styling with backdrop blur and border effects. The overall design now has a modern, minimal aesthetic that matches iOS 26 design principles.",
